I chose the cloudy sky I made using different types of noise (noiseLevel, noiseScale) because I feel like this was the first code I fully started to understand the capabilties of noise in code and I was really happy with the outcome I got. I proud of this code at the time and it made me see how far I had come when I looked back at what I had started out doing with p5js (basic shapes). In the future I would like to continue to learn more about how noise works and its capabilties.

I chose the falling strobe ball because it was a combination of three different coding techniques we had learnt in p5js. Random, noise and if statements. I like this code because I feel I brought all of these techniques together however I could definetly improve my knowledge of if statements. I didn't achieve what I initially set out to with this code because I intended for the circle to bounce back up but couldn't figure out how to do this using if statements. Therefore I hope to continue to learn more about ifstatements as I feel I still don't have a very full understanding of them.


I chose the rotaing line over a forlooped ellipse becuase even though these are two simple techniques I really like the look of the pattern they form. coding this was fundamental momement for me as I continued to use these techniques throughout my coding in the first half of the semester. I particularly liked the interesting patterns that result from tightly repeated forloop circles because they produce a CD like reflective quality. I feel I have a good understanding of rotate but I would like better understand similar functions such as translate.
